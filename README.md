## Project 1: Part of Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models

Part of speech tagging is the process of determining the syntactic category of a word from the words in its surrounding context. It is often used to help disambiguate natural language phrases because it can be done quickly with high accuracy. Tagging can be used for many NLP tasks like determining correct pronunciation during speech synthesis (for example, dis-count as a noun vs dis-count as a verb), for information retrieval, and for word sense disambiguatio

## Project 2: Machine Translation
Machine translation is a popular topic in research with new papers coming out every year. Over the years of research, different methods were created, like rule-based, statistical, and example-based machine translation. With all this effort, itâ€™s still an unsolved problem. However, neural networks have made a large leap forward in machine translation.

In this notebook, you will build a deep neural network that functions as part of an end-to-end machine translation pipeline. Your completed pipeline will accept English text as input and return the French translation.
